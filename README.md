# Summary
Welcome to Hack With Suraj Institute of Open Source University

Hello everyone,

I am Suraj Yadav, a professional software engineer with five years of experience and the founder of this university. Despite being a 10th-grade dropout, I embarked on a journey to become a computer scientist through self-directed learning. I have navigated this unconventional path with determination and resilience, transforming my passion for technology into a successful career.

At Hack With Suraj Institute of Open Source University, I am committed to sharing my entire self-learning journey with you. I will provide access to all the content, tools, and resources that I utilized to achieve my goals. My aim is to empower and inspire you to forge your own path in the world of technology, regardless of traditional educational backgrounds.

Join me as I share the lessons from my failures and successes, and guide you through the steps that led me to where I am today. Together, we will explore the vast possibilities of self-directed learning and open-source technology, paving the way for your success in the field of computer science.

**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
- *Foundational Knowledge*: To help students understand about CSE and understand the basics of the field of CSE and create dual level projects and understand how the software industry works.
<!-- - *Basic of CSE*: To understand the real requirement of Mathematics and Physics to become a Computer Scientist and to get the first stop in the journey of becoming a Computer Scientist by self-learning path. -->




**Cost** At HSIOSU, we believe in making education accessible to all. While some courses may incur costs for graded assignments or projects, we encourage students to decide how much or how little to spend based on their own time and budget constraints. Remember, success cannot simply be purchased â€“ dedication, effort, and perseverance are the true currencies of achievement in your educational journey.

Thank you for choosing Hack With Suraj Institute of Open Source University. We look forward to embarking on this educational journey with you!
