**What is reason this Curriculum is free ?** 
The reason for this is rooted in my own experiences. As the founder, I faced significant difficulties in finding quality knowledge to become a competent software engineer. The outdated curriculums offered by many colleges do not adequately prepare students for the demands of the software industry. Additionally, the high costs of college education make it inaccessible for many aspiring engineers. Even those who manage to secure admission often find that their education does not equip them with the necessary skills, leading them to seek knowledge online, wasting valuable time in the process.

To address these issues, I have created this free curriculum to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to receive a quality education. By offering all content for free, I aim to solve these problems and provide a pathway for aspiring software engineers to succeed without the financial and educational barriers traditionally associated with college education.

**Organization**. The curriculum is designed as follows:
